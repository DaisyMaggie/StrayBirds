#### What are some of the general challenges in building a web search engine?
  
###### Scalability challenges
  
   * How to handle the size of the web and ensure completeness of coverage?
   * How to serve many user queries quickly?

###### Low quality information and spams
###### New pages are constantly created and soem pages may be updated very quickly

#### What is a crawler? How can we implement a simple crawler?


#### What is focused crawling? What is incremental crawling?

#### What kind of pages should have a higher priority for recrawling in incremental crawling?
#### What can we do if the inverted index doesn’t fit in any single machine?
#### What’s the basic idea of Google File System (GFS)?
#### How does MapReduce work? What are the two key functions that a programmer needs to implement when programming with a MapReduce framework?
#### How can we use MapReduce to build an inverted index in parallel?
#### What is anchor text? Why is it useful for improving search accuracy?
#### What is a hub page? What is an authority page?
#### What kind of web pages tend to receive high scores from PageRank?
#### How can we interpret PageRank from the perspective of a random surfer “walking” on the web?
#### How exactly do you compute PageRank scores?
#### How does the HITS algorithm work?
#### What’s the basic idea of learning to rank?
#### How can logistic regression be used to combine multiple features for improving ranking accuracy of a search engine?
#### What is content-based information filtering?
#### How can we use a linear utility function to evaluate a filtering system? How should we set the coefficients in such a linear utility function?
#### How can we extend a retrieval system to perform content-based information filtering?
#### What is exploration-exploitation tradeoff?
#### How does the beta-gamma threshold learning algorithm work?
#### What is the basic idea of collaborative filtering?
#### How does the memory-based collaborative filtering algorithm work?
#### What is the “cold start” problem in collaborative filtering?
